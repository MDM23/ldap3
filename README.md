# Ldap3 Server (Protocol Bindings)

This is a work-in-progress of LDAP3 server and client capable protocol bindings.

This is *not* an LDAP3 server or client - it is the required parts to allow you to build one
using a TCP server/client. You will and should develop your own state machine, and
should consider the many security risks of LDAP3 such as filter stack limits,
request sizelimits, number of entries limited in results, binds and how you
check access controls, and more.

## Structure

This library contains all the needed protocol bindings, mapped to their BER structures
in `proto`, as well as a set of `simple` wrappers of common operations required for
a server, discarding many of the esoteric options that are generally not required.

## Examples

There is an example hardcoded server using tokio in `examples`

## Things we won't add

StartTLS has a number of security issues compared to LDAPS, and should *not* be used, or developed
as it is not only more complex, but also worse than LDAPS. Use LDAPS.

SASL is extremely complicated, and there are very few clients that require it over simple bind. It's
not really worth the time to add it. If it is contributed, I will only accept SASL as an
authentication mechanism - I won't accept the SASL transport encryption layer, as it's just
too complicated. Again, use LDAPS.

## Notes:

LDAP - the trashfire we have, not the trashfire we want.
